I just received a phone call from my doctor with the results from my follow up chest xray and find out that the pneumonia has not gone away and is still about the same size.  What should be our next step?  She wants to put me on another type of anibiotic. Doctor: Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern.You are having persistent lung opacity despite of antibiotic treatment.So possibility of these is very high. 1. Drug resistant infection2. MalignancySo better to first diagnose and then start appropriate treatment.Bronchoscopy and CT scan of thorax are advised in your case.Bronchoscopy will isolate the causative organism and guide about specific antibiotic therapy.CT scan will tell you if there is mass lesion present or not.Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.

 Patient: Good day, My son, who is 4 yrs old, has been diagnosed with lobar pneumonia and is now hospitalised.  This is about his 6th or 7th infection.  He had a double aortic arch that led to the entrance of his right lung and his trachea and esophagus being squeezed. He is now diagnosed with asthma.  Can the pneumonia deplete his lung function over time? What, if anything, can I do to reduce the number of infections? Doctor: Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern.Yes, recurrent lung infections can directly diminish lung functions.Recurrent infections can also cause asthma, bronchitis and further deteriorate lung functions.Best way to prevent respiratory tract infection is vaccines.Give him pneumococcal and influenza vaccines.These vaccines will provide 80% protection. Give him fruits, multivitamin tablets and protein powder for high immunity.Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your son. Thanks.

 Patient: hello doc.Im Gigi 51 yrs old previously i have ptb but the doctor told me that it was cured already 7 yrs ago every time i go to his clinic he told me i have a pneumonia after en x-ray result even though i told him that i spit w/ blood last monday i go to his clinic agin for a medical check up and he prescribed me cefuruxime kefstar i bought 9 pcs only and switch to another brand of cefuruxime Axetil after 4 days i spit mucus w/ blood as for now im suffering severe backpain what should i do thank you so much doc Doctor: Hello Gigi !Coughing up blood with sputum (henoptysis) is a red flag sign .. meaning to say it definitely needs Medical attention . Considering you have had TB in the past there are many possibilities for your present episodes of hemoptysis.  It could me a bacterial infection or relapse of TB or post TB bronchiectasis (abnormal permanent dilation of your airways at few places which happens when they get damaged due to your past TB). Take a course of antibiotic as prescribed by your physician ,Consult with your physician  and discuss about taking drugs like tranexemic acid which reduce the bleeding tendency , cough suppressants . while sleeping, Lie on the side which was previously affected by TB and be on complete bed rest . Once your hemoptysis gets controlled go for sputum examination to check for TB bacilli , chest x ray and if needed HRCT thorax (to pick up bronchiectasis which can sometimes be not evident on x ray). Since u mentioned severe back pain , vascular abnormalities concerning  the descending aorta (the major blood vessel carrying blood from the heart)needs to be also considered  Treatment is to be decided based on the cause for your hemoptysis.Do review with your physician and get the necessary investigations done.  
 Patient: dear doctor my littel son 11 months when he was 2 months and 15 days he got chest infection pneumonia in the right lung and after 2 weeks of treatment in the hospital with antibiotic he discharged next day he was admitted again with new infected by pneumonia in the right lung and then doctor did some test a barium swallow and ph. the resulte GE reflux grade 4. he was with NGT and AR formula by NGT for 3 moths with zantac and Motinorm also with sitting position ,but all of those dosn t change any thing.after that when he was 5 months and 15 days he had an a laparoscopic fundoplication 5 ports, 360m degree wrap over 10fr ryles tube. he trying to vomit but he can t.I Observed every time when he trying to vomit like for 5 to 7 minutes and when he sneeze every time after trying vomit then he got back to normal after sneezing.. and he drinking now neocate formula based on free amino acid. also he is allergy with lots of food ,.

She was moved to ICU Saturday and they still can t seem to get it under control. I am very desperate and need a 2nd professional opinion. Doctor: Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Best treatment of pneumonia is identification of causative pathogen and start appropriate antibiotics. So get done sputum culture and sensitivity report. Culture report will isolate the causative organism and sensitivity report will guide about effective antibiotic treatment. So consult pulmonologist and discuss all these.

 Patient: my cousin was admitted yesterday for pneumonia and a collasped lung which was diagnoised yesterday. they did surgery this morning by cleaning out and draining fluids. she is now heavily sadated with a tube in her right lung. what will it take for her to get well again? Doctor: It sound like your cousin has something called- Empyema. It is basically an abscess in the chest cavity. And the correct treatment for it is drainage - which was done appropriatley. But he should receive antibiotic treatment with coverage of both aerobic and anaerobic organisms. Usually specimens are send from the procedure to see which organisms grow and provide a more directed antibiotic coverage.  
 Patient: my mother was diagnosed with left basal pneumonia she is 74 yeas old and was discharged from hospital yesterday was given amoxicillin and clarithromycin but now she is being sick and has diarohhea she has had amoxicillin before which hasnt effected her this way will it be the other antibiotics also what is left basal pneumonia Doctor: Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, her diarrhoea is mostly due to amoxicillin. Amoxicillin can cause diarrhea on second exposure. So you should stop amoxicillin. There are options for oral antibiotics other than amoxicillin like cefixime, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin etc. And left basal pneumonia means lung infection in lower lobe of left lung. So antibiotics are the mainstay of treatment. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your mother.Thanks. 
 Patient: my mom was diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia back in late december. After a round of antibiotics, she felt much better but the xray still showed pneumonia. A round of stronger antibiotics were then given to her. She went back for a follow up xray last week and the xray now shows the pneumonia is in both lungs. The strange thing is...she has NO symptoms. No coughing, no fever, nothing. Could it possibly be viral? or fluid? or cancer???? Btw she has never smoked in her life. Doctor: Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Radiological resolution takes 2-3 weeks in pneumonia. So it is possible that patient of pneumonia is improved symptomatically but still show pneumonia on chest x ray. So in my opinion, you should should waiting for 2 weeks more. Get done repeat chest x ray after 2 weeks.If chest x ray is showing pneumonia then go for CT thorax and bronchoscopy to rule out lung cancer, Tuberculosis, Fungal pneumonia. If xun4 ray is improving then no need to worry. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your mother. Thanks. 
 Patient: I have been sick with a sinus infection and tonsillitis over the last week and a half. i am on antibiotics for these. Now I feel it in my chest. I am coughing non stop. My throat doesnt hurt much just from the coughing. My chest feels heavy and I have some issues with breathing. Could this be bronchitis or pneumonia ? Doctor: Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Your symptoms are seen with both, bronchitis and pneumonia. And both of these them are common after upper respiratory tract infection (URTI - sinusitis). So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system, chest x ray and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). Chest x ray is needed for the diagnosis of pneumonia. PFT is must for the diagnosis of bronchitis. Antibiotics are the mainstay of treatment for pneumonia. Inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) are the mainstay of treatment for bronchitis. So first diagnose android then start appropriate treatment.. Hope I have solved your query.

 Patient: I was recently diagnosed with Pneumonia. I had pneumonia when I was a baby but never since. I was shocked when I heard the diagnosis. The symptoms became apparent on March 28. I began taking Doxycycline Monohydrate on Monday April 3 and must take them for seven days. I am mega healthy and have not been sick in years. I can t even remember the last time I was sick. This has really knocked me out. I have zero energy and very little appetite. How does pneumonia manifest in the lung and how does bacteria get in there? How long will it be until I recover? I am really having a hard time with this. Help! Doctor: Respected user , HiThanks for using Healthcaremagic.comI have evaluated your query thoroughly .*  Mechanism of pneumonia follows as   -  Susceptible pathogens in form of bacteria enters the respiratory tract      via  nose or throat ( air borne ) , settles  there in respective lung tissues      through aleveoli and bronchi  -  start manifestations in form of various symptoms  of bronchitis ,      effusion or others .*  Treatment  guidelines   -  Maintain hydration with plenty of liquids .  -  Balanced nutritious  diet .  -  Regular antibiotics , anti inflammatory , decongestants as per advise      by your doctor .  -  Regular walking , exercises ( deep breathing ) , YOGA .  -  Avoid smoking , alcohol .  -  Have patience , recovery time depends upon the causative organism ,      host response factors and type of treatment ( it may take days to       weeks ) .Hope this clears your query .Welcome  for  any  further  assistance .Regards . 
 Patient: my friend suffers from diagnosed bronchiectias and gets pneumonia constantly.  She is 72  Each time they give her antibotics for a week and then the xray will show the pneumonia gone, however, it contantly returns.  She has been to Mayo, Iowa City   had many test.  It's beginning to take a toll on her.  I would say she had pneumonia about 6 times last year and so far 2 or 3 this year.  Any suggestions Doctor: Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Bronchiectesis is permanently damaged part of lung. So bacterial colonization is common in bronchiectesis. And this gives repeated pneumonia attacks. So best and permanent cure for this is surgical removal of bronchiectic part of lung. So consult Cardio thoracic surgeon and discuss about surgical removal. Another option is culture and sensitivity based treatment. Get done sputum culture and sensitivity report. Culture will identify the causative organism and sensitivity report will guide about effective antibiotic treatment. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your friend. Thanks.

 Patient: my son is 3 years old, and came down with a head cold wed, it moved immediately to his chest (he is a preemie-grad, and has had trouble with pneumonia and rsv in past) he is running a temp, and his respiratory rate is between 48-50.  I just don't know if i should wait it out a little longer to see what the day brings or take him in. I hate feelling like i'm always there for the slightest things with him, but his history proves medical intervention always was the case.

Please take him to ER immediately and take a chest x-ray immediately.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards,Dr. Siva Kumar Reddy 
 Patient: I have had a Percocet addiction for 35 years and have had many Dr.s in that time span. I was up to without exaggeration, eating 240 10mg p s, 98 30mg oxycodone pills, as well as an assortment of 5mg pills which were always at my disposal. I have cancer and have severe back injuries but along with the p s I also had monthly access to 240 2mg xannax pills which after awhile Ihad no problem eating all of the above each month and would look for some more. I died 4 times in a 6 year span due to double pneumonia which the Dr.s told me my medications were playing a large roll in this. When I was 16 I became an atheist due to my brother dying, he was my favorite and I became very drug dependent to kill the pain. This lead to my later addictions and no matter what I tried I could not escape their grip.The last time I was in the hospital I said Lord I do not know if you are real but if you are I am begging you to open my heart again to you and I need your help or this will probably be it for me when I leave the hospital, I have had enough, and this is only the drug portion of my life I would not wish the things and amount of death I have had to witness on anyone. I am the last of all my friends left alive and I am 53years old. Over 40 friends have passed on, 2 of which I grew up with from the age of 5, others just would not listen. I lost 2 older brothers, 1 my 1st year in highschool the other 8 years later of an overdose. Needless to say ptsd, depression and other problems haunted me until I did as many drugs as possible to bury the pain, but demons only stay buried so long which I found out the hard way. tiny2882@comcat,net Doctor: Respected user, hi I evaluated whole long query in total details thoroughly .* Now only options left for you is holistic healing with herbs & other things.* Current respiratory details & status are not mentioned with symptoms to   figure out for the pneumonia, but for mental condition I can say that only   & only thing which can help you to any extent is   very deep meditation sessions on highly regular basis   2-3 hours of dedicated YOGA daily    which will give your inner soul & subcouncious mind the level of peace   you are lacking at present .Hope this helps you .Welcome for any further assistance .Thanks  for using Healthcaremagic.com & giving me an opportunity to assistWishing you a healthy life ahead .Regards dear take care.

 Patient: My fianc√© has been coughing uncontrollably every night for the past 4 months. He is 23 years old, 5'9", about 140 lbs., and has been told by his dr that he has walking pneumonia. He has been prescribed antibiotics, cough syrup, allergy medicine, mucinex, nasal sprays, and inhalers and although they suppress the coughing at times he still does not seem to have gotten rid of the coughing. His coughing is accompanied with phlegm and has also caused him to throw up due to the extremity. He does smoke cigars as well. What is this!? Doctor: Walking pneumonia is a non-medical term to describe a mild case of pneumonia. It is usually called atypical pneumonia because the disease is different from more serious cases of pneumonia caused by typical bacteria. it is often the result of a lung infection from a bacterial microorganism called Mycoplasma pneumoniae and generally treated with antibiotics. Mild infections are often not treated because they tend to clear on their own. With treatment, most people begin to feel better within a few days.  
 Patient: Went to the doctor 3 weeks ago for possible exercise induced asthma due to chest pain. They have me a daily steriod inhaler and albuterol rescue inhaler. The did an xray as well and a few days later I found out I had pneumonia. I did a zpack for 5 days and now levaquin 500mg twice daily on day 7 or 10. Just last night I went to urgent they said I still have the pneumonia got a steroid injection and a medrol dose pack. Still getting worse...not sure what to do and the chest pain seems worse, and the levaquin has made my stomach very irritated which is expected. The steroids make sleeping impossible and I constantly feel overheated since the injections and dose pack I started yesterday. Doctor: Hi and welcome in HCMAccording to the history this might be  a situation called *Nonresponding Pneumonia*It would be better to be hospitalized for further examinations like:CRPHemogramALT,ASTChest CT (if needed)ABGFor exploring better the situation and do the treatment in i/v route .If you have comorbidites they should be evaluated too.Sometimes when the other comorbidities are not well treated the pneumonia does not respond so well from the treatment.So please discuss with your doctor for the aboveRegardsDr.Jolanda  
 Patient: Patient: I went to the doctor today and found out that I have pneumonia. I got a steroid injection and breathing treatment in the office and was sent home with levaquin, albuterol, and cough medicine. My forearms and legs are very tingly and almost numb and heavy feeling. Is this from the steroid injection? I am 23 years old and I have juvenile rheumatoid arthritis so I am also taking humira, methotrexate, plaquenil, and folic acid for the RA. Is this a side effect or a drug reaction or nothing to be concerned about? Doctor: Tingling in extremities may be a sign of peripheral neuropathy, wich is most of the cases caused by inflammatory injury to the nerves. Anti-TNF drugs, such as Humira, have been reported to be associated to this kind of injury, that can be potentialized when associated to steroids. You should visit your attending rheumathologist for physical evaluation and apropriate management. 
 Patient: My father is in the hospital on ventilator currently.  The doctor says he now has what is considered whiteout in his lungs.  He has said that the outline of the heart can no longer be seen.  My father aspirated and then was diagnosed with pneumonia.  Three days later he ended up in ccu on a ventilator and has not been able to be weened off/  He is currently taking 3 antibiotics.  What is your advise. Doctor: Lung whiteout and loss of heart outline are findings of chest x-ray compatible with many abnormal conditions affecting the lungs, like pneumonia, pleural effusion, acute respiratory distress syndrome among others. In the actual setting, your father is already receiving treatment to his pneumonia. All the other possibilities are probably been considerated and adressed by CCU staff. Weaning from mechanical ventilation is sometimes challenging because many factors can impair patients evolution, like how long he's been in MV, his nutrition status, his cardiovascular performance and resolution of the cause that led him to MV in the first place. 
 Patient: My husband, age 63 is feeling cool on his abdomen and back while the rest of him is warm...currently sleeping. Last week was diagnosed with pneumonia...had a period last week when he was so cold, couldn t get warm so we went to the hospital. He says he is feeling fine and feels OK to work everyday (does construction work outside on a normal basis). Should I be concerned tonight that part of him feels cool even when under covera for an hour or two Thanks so much Doctor: Hello and thank you for asking in HCM I can understand your concern Don't worry so much. Your husband is under treatment for pneumonia according to the history and he has had fever several times.Now he feels better but he is not completely asymptomatic which means that the feeling he had might be due to an episode of temperature not so high .This shows that the treatment is doing well. But he has to be careful with the treatment to be correct as the doctor has prescribed ,no smoking and not to work in dust environment ,a lot of liquids too.Take careWish a fast recovery for your husband.

This definitely sounds like Influenza is starting.( Unless you have any obvious reason to suspect COVID-19,Malaria,Tick Bite Fever or Glandular Fever).Rest,Vitamin C and a suitable over the counter painkiller. I would advise avoiding Ibuprofen and other Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory medication.

  Patient: Hi Dr. If all I have is a dry cough, should I get tested for covid 19? No recent travel or contact with high risk individuals. I have been given permission to visit a relative in ICU during the lockdown, but don't want to make him sick. Doctor: Sounds risky. Using symptoms of fever, cough, or runny nose to screen for COVID-19 is not accurate because colds and flu have such symptoms. COVID testing is by nasal swab, but there's a shortage of test kits in this pandemic. Only local resources know local testing sites, times, restrictions. Even a negative test does not guarantee one does not have COVID-19. Safest for people to stay away from ICU patients.

  Patient: My 68 yr old mom is waiting for corona virus results. She‚Äôs been having fever 101-102 for a week. Was admitted to hospital and has pneumonia. How is it treated and should she stay at the hospital until her symptoms get better? She has HTN. Help! Doctor: COVID-19? It sounds like your mom is in good hands. If she has COVID, they will know how to treat it. If the pneumonia is beleived to be bacterial, they will treat with antibiotics. There is no proved effective treatment for coronavirus itself. Ask her doctors if she is a candidate for remdesivir -- not proved effective but sometimes available on a "compassionate" basis for severely ill patients. Good luck. 
 Patient: Should someone with a compromised immune system due to rheumatoid arthritis get the flu vaccine, especially during the COVID-19 crisis? Also, does the flu vaccine in South Africa use live or dead viruses? Doctor: In brief:   Flu vaccine   Any flu vaccine will cause your immune system to respond.  I advise,if your decision is to be vaccinated,to do it over a period of 6 weeks..I like a little bit on day 1 ,then more 2 weeks later and more two weeks later still.That way you get the full killed vaccine ,and your body develops an immune response with its ability still intact to fight Covid 19 if necessary.

   If you've been infected by SARS-CoV-2, develop Covid-19 symptoms and recover, can you: 1) develop immunity to Covid-19 2) infect others after 14 days post-symptom onset & recovery 3) get re-infected later by SARS-CoV-2 despite developing immunity?   Patient: If you've been infected by SARS-CoV-2, develop Covid-19 symptoms and recover, can you: 1) develop immunity to Covid-19 2) infect others after 14 days post-symptom onset & recovery 3) get re-infected later by SARS-CoV-2 despite developing immunity? Doctor: Yes, Maybe, Maybe. We presume one is immune to a respiratory virus for a while after getting the infection (that's the way it is with other viruses). A few people have trouble with their antibodies and don't have much immunity. Shedding of viruses sometimes is longer than 14 days. In life, there will always be some people who get reinfected, for whatever reason. Usually one is immune after the infection. (3/21/20)
