I just received a phone call from my doctor with the results from my follow up chest xray and find out that the pneumonia has not gone away and is still about the same size.  What should be our next step?  She wants to put me on another type of anibiotic. Doctor: Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern.You are having persistent lung opacity despite of antibiotic treatment.So possibility of these is very high. 1. Drug resistant infection2.

      " Patient: Good day, My son, who is 4 yrs old, has been diagnosed with lobar pneumonia and is now hospitalised.  This is about his 6th or 7th infection.  He had a double aortic arch that led to the entrance of his right lung and his trachea and esophagus being squeezed. He is now diagnosed with asthma.  Can the pneumonia deplete his lung function over time? What, if anything, can I do to reduce the number of infections? Doctor: Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern.Yes, recurrent lung infections can directly diminish lung functions.Recurrent infections can also cause asthma, bronchitis and further deteriorate lung functions.Best way to prevent respiratory tract infection is vaccines.Give him pneumococcal and influenza vaccines.These vaccines will provide 80% protection. Give him fruits, multivitamin tablets and protein powder for high immunity.Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your son. Thanks.  \r",

Considering you have had TB in the past there are many possibilities for your present episodes of hemoptysis.  It could me a bacterial infection or relapse of TB or post TB bronchiectasis (abnormal permanent dilation of your airways at few places which happens when they get damaged due to your past TB). Take a course of antibiotic as prescribed by your physician ,Consult with your physician  and discuss about taking drugs like tranexemic acid which reduce the bleeding tendency , cough suppressants . while sleeping, Lie on the side which was previously affected by TB and be on complete bed rest . Once your hemoptysis gets controlled go for sputum examination to check for TB bacilli , chest x ray and if needed HRCT thorax (to pick up bronchiectasis which can sometimes be not evident on x ray). Since u mentioned severe back pain , vascular abnormalities concerning  the descending aorta (the major blood vessel carrying blood from the heart)needs to be also considered  Treatment is to be decided based on the cause for your hemoptysis.Do review with your physician and get the necessary investigations done.  \r",

Doctor: It sound like your cousin has something called- Empyema. It is basically an abscess in the chest cavity. And the correct treatment for it is drainage - which was done appropriatley. But he should receive antibiotic treatment with coverage of both aerobic and anaerobic organisms.

I can understand your concern. In my opinion, her diarrhoea is mostly due to amoxicillin. Amoxicillin can cause diarrhea on second exposure. So you should stop amoxicillin.

      " Patient: I have a pneumonia and have gone through 1 full round of a zpack and steroid. I m also using an inhaler, had to go back to dog on Thursday night because I was still not any better. They gave me a antibiotic shot and a 1/10day script for levaquin which I started about 10am Friday morning. I m still not feeling better. I now as of this morning have a sharp pain inbetween shoulder blades that comes and goes, my heart flutters sometimes and sometimes beats really fast, I also woke up to chest pain that would go from burning feeling to sharp pain for about 30 min consecutively, then stopped and has been on and off since then. My cough is so bad that when I cough it feels like my ribs/lower sides of my back/lung area are bruised/fractured and takes my breath away when I take deap breathes or bend my waiste. I noticed bout a 5 days ago that I would get really hot at random times. Ao thinking i was having a fever, I ve been keeping track daily of my bt as of about 3/4 days ago and it s seems to have steadily slowly dropped. It s ranging usually from 96-97 but sometimes it ll get to like 98.0 and thats while I m sweating so bad that s my shirt will be soaked and hair wet like I was standing outside in the sun for an hr in middle of summer. It s sick. Should I be worried? Doctor: Respected user , hi Thanks for using Healthcaremagic.comI have evaluated your query thoroughly .* All symptoms are in relation with underlying lung condition giving rise to   broncho alveolar constrictions , pleura irritation with systemic    manifestations* As there is not much relief of oral medications given till now , I strongly   recommend to get hospitalised treatment & early better recovery through   IV antibiotics , bronchodilators, supportive nursing care Hope this clears your queryWelcome for any further assistance Regards . \r",

I just don't know if i should wait it out a little longer to see what the day brings or take him in. I hate feelling like i'm always there for the slightest things with him, but his history proves medical intervention always was the case.

      " Patient: I have had a Percocet addiction for 35 years and have had many Dr.s in that time span. I was up to without exaggeration, eating 240 10mg p s, 98 30mg oxycodone pills, as well as an assortment of 5mg pills which were always at my disposal. I have cancer and have severe back injuries but along with the p s I also had monthly access to 240 2mg xannax pills which after awhile Ihad no problem eating all of the above each month and would look for some more. I died 4 times in a 6 year span due to double pneumonia which the Dr.s told me my medications were playing a large roll in this. When I was 16 I became an atheist due to my brother dying, he was my favorite and I became very drug dependent to kill the pain. This lead to my later addictions and no matter what I tried I could not escape their grip.The last time I was in the hospital I said Lord I do not know if you are real but if you are I am begging you to open my heart again to you and I need your help or this will probably be it for me when I leave the hospital, I have had enough, and this is only the drug portion of my life I would not wish the things and amount of death I have had to witness on anyone. I am the last of all my friends left alive and I am 53years old. Over 40 friends have passed on, 2 of which I grew up with from the age of 5, others just would not listen. I lost 2 older brothers, 1 my 1st year in highschool the other 8 years later of an overdose. Needless to say ptsd, depression and other problems haunted me until I did as many drugs as possible to bury the pain, but demons only stay buried so long which I found out the hard way. tiny2882@comcat,net Doctor: Respected user, hi I evaluated whole long query in total details thoroughly .* Now only options left for you is holistic healing with herbs & other things.* Current respiratory details & status are not mentioned with symptoms to   figure out for the pneumonia, but for mental condition I can say that only   & only thing which can help you to any extent is   very deep meditation sessions on highly regular basis   2-3 hours of dedicated YOGA daily    which will give your inner soul & subcouncious mind the level of peace   you are lacking at present .Hope this helps you .Welcome for any further assistance .Thanks  for using Healthcaremagic.com & giving me an opportunity to assistWishing you a healthy life ahead .Regards dear take care. \r",

His coughing is accompanied with phlegm and has also caused him to throw up due to the extremity. He does smoke cigars as well. What is this!? Doctor: Walking pneumonia is a non-medical term to describe a mild case of pneumonia. It is usually called atypical pneumonia because the disease is different from more serious cases of pneumonia caused by typical bacteria. it is often the result of a lung infection from a bacterial microorganism called Mycoplasma pneumoniae and generally treated with antibiotics. Mild infections are often not treated because they tend to clear on their own. With treatment, most people begin to feel better within a few days.  \r",

Is this from the steroid injection? I am 23 years old and I have juvenile rheumatoid arthritis so I am also taking humira, methotrexate, plaquenil, and folic acid for the RA. Is this a side effect or a drug reaction or nothing to be concerned about? Doctor: Tingling in extremities may be a sign of peripheral neuropathy, wich is most of the cases caused by inflammatory injury to the nerves. Anti-TNF drugs, such as Humira, have been reported to be associated to this kind of injury, that can be potentialized when associated to steroids.

Three days later he ended up in ccu on a ventilator and has not been able to be weened off/  He is currently taking 3 antibiotics.  What is your advise. Doctor: Lung whiteout and loss of heart outline are findings of chest x-ray compatible with many abnormal conditions affecting the lungs, like pneumonia, pleural effusion, acute respiratory distress syndrome among others. In the actual setting, your father is already receiving treatment to his pneumonia. All the other possibilities are probably been considerated and adressed by CCU staff. Weaning from mechanical ventilation is sometimes challenging because many factors can impair patients evolution, like how long he's been in MV, his nutrition status, his cardiovascular performance and resolution of the cause that led him to MV in the first place. \r",

      " Patient: My husband, age 63 is feeling cool on his abdomen and back while the rest of him is warm...currently sleeping. Last week was diagnosed with pneumonia...had a period last week when he was so cold, couldn t get warm so we went to the hospital. He says he is feeling fine and feels OK to work everyday (does construction work outside on a normal basis). Should I be concerned tonight that part of him feels cool even when under covera for an hour or two Thanks so much Doctor: Hello and thank you for asking in HCM I can understand your concern Don't worry so much. Your husband is under treatment for pneumonia according to the history and he has had fever several times.Now he feels better but he is not completely asymptomatic which means that the feeling he had might be due to an episode of temperature not so high .This shows that the treatment is doing well. But he has to be careful with the treatment to be correct as the doctor has prescribed ,no smoking and not to work in dust environment ,a lot of liquids too.Take careWish a fast recovery for your husband.

It has been four to five days and has drunk a lot of Benadryl and took Paracetamol too. Doctors have shut the OP so do not know what to do? Please help.Hello, I understand your concern. I just have a few more questions.Does your cough has phlegm? Any other symptoms like difficulty breathing? Any other medical condition such as asthma, hypertension? Are you a smoker? Alcoholic beverage drinker?I have phlegm but not a lot. A tiny amount comes out most of the time. I have no difficulty in breathing. No medical conditions and not a smoker nor a drinker.I would recommend you take n-acetylcysteine 200 mg powder dissolved in water three times a day. You may also nebulize using PNSS (saline nebulizer) three times a day. This will help the phlegm to come out. I would also recommend you take vitamin C 500 mg and zinc to boost your immune system. If symptoms persist, worsen or new onset of symptoms has been noted, further consult is advised.\r",

      "Hello doctor, I am suffering from coughing, throat infection from last week. At that time fever did not persist and also did not felt any chest pain. Two days later, I consulted with a doctor. He prescribed Cavidur 625, Montek LC, Ambrolite syrup and Betaline gargle solution. Since then throat infection improved and frequent cough also coming out. Coughing also improved remarkably though not completely. From yesterday onwards fever is occuring (maximum 100-degree Celcius). I have not come in touch with any foreign returned person nor went outside. In our state, there is no incidence of Covid-19. Please suggest what to do?I can understand your concern.In my opinion, you should get done a chest x-ray and CBC (complete blood count). If both these are normal then no need to worry much. I hope this helps.Your total count is on the higher side of normal along with low hemoglobin. So start Azithromycin 500 mg 1-0-0, Tablet Dolo 650 1-0-1. Once your fever and cough subside, start an Iron tablet for low hemoglobin.\r",

Maybe like every 30 minutes or less or so feel more chills running down my body and chest feeling bit weird like I am starting having trouble breathing then goes back to normal and repeats, with weird feeling like chills down my left and right lungs or left and right upper chest. Also, my heart was pumping fast. Also, some minor coughs were there since seven days ago, still here. I have white mucus and have not gotten yellow yet.I took medicines yesterday but today I got severe cold and flu medicine with a pain reliever, the chills did not go away. Then today, I called the doctor on the phone and told him what happen last night and the same thing happened this morning too. I had minor coughs, feeling lightheaded, feel like maybe cannot breathe or something, and a lot of burping. I told him the burping issue was going on for at least two years, but somehow this time I am feeling lightheaded. He just gives Pepcid, a try maybe GERD. I ate that today still feeling chills now and still burping a lot.Right now, still some chills on arms, with breathing issue or something makes my chest feel weird and arm sometimes. So, should I be worried? I do not think I have a fever now but do not feel hot on the forehead? Was it GERD or flu, it is Coronavirus or something else? I hope it is not Coronavirus.I am 21 years old and weigh around 110-115 kg.Can you try taking Sudafed, Tylenol, and Zyrtec and try getting sleep for a few days? I am sure that will make you feel better.Avoid exposure to smoke dust and cold winds. Keep the AC to a minimum or use ceiling fan instead. Drink plenty of water and warm fluids. Avoid eating out, partying. Avoid unnecessary travel.\r",

Patient: Can Covid-19 be transmitted sexually? Can any coronavirus be transmitted sexually? Doctor: In brief: Sort of If you are having sex with someone who has Covid-19 you are quite at risk of getting it. High likelihood if kissing and having intercourse but it may not be transmitted through intercourse but the closeness in an intimate situation like that with someone who is infected gives a high likelihood of transmission.   27   Patient: Have read COVID-19 news quoting some experts as saying that we will see more confirmed cases as more tests are performed, but the mortality rate should drop as that happens. Any sign of that yet? Doctor: In brief: COVID-19 mortality Don't confuse actual mortality rate with REPORTED rate. The actual rate probably will remain stable (and likely lower in the US than some other countries, because of sophisticated intensive medical care). But as testing expands and more people with mild symptoms (or no symptoms) are diagnosed, reported mortality will decline; likely happening now, but it may take weeks for data to be known.     Patient: I travelled to Austria on 25 Jan 2020 and returned on 31Jan 2020. My trip included a stopover in Munich. I currently do not show any symptoms listed for coronavirus. Should i get lab tested as a precaution and will this test be covered by the medical? Doctor: In brief: Hard to say The questions you pose are more appropriate to ask your local physicians and health plans. As a USA based site we have no access to or information about the changing local recommendations for world travel around the globe nor would we know what your plan covers. Find a local health contact & contact your health plan for guidance.    Patient: For students in dorms living with students from many countries, what extra additional precautions do they need to prevent catching novel coronavirus? Doctor: In brief: Standard precautions COVID-19 is now official name for the illness caused by the newly discovered coronavirus (COronaVirus Infectious Disease - 2019). So far it is extremely rare in the US (2/12/20). Until and unless COVID-19 becomes common no special precautions are necessary. In any dormitory or group living situation people with respiratory symptoms (colds, flu, etc.) should cover their coughs and wash hands frequently.    Patient: Can taking extra vitamin C every day help prevent you from catching the coronavirus or the flu? If so, how much vitamin C is recommended? Doctor: In brief: Vitamin C While getting enough vitamin C in your diet is highly recommended, it has no special ability to prevent coronavirus or flu virus. Best preventative measures for these are frequent handwashing and avoiding people with sneezing/coughing/cold symptoms and fevers.    31\r",

      "  Last tuesday I had a flu shot and a neumonia shot. I am 68 and male. I had a very sore arm and felt bad the next day in which I had blood drawn for a test. The results showed a high white cell blood count as well as high ANC and AMC. Could these high readings be because of the shots the day before? Doctor: Hello,  * The pneumonia shot per se is not responsible for high WBC count, but as you are telling there are soreness and bad feeling at the injection site over arm, there are all possibilities that you have cellulitis or possible abscess formation at the injection site; which will recruit neutrophils at the site and cause secondary rise in WBC count.  * Primary relief with ice application and secondary management with systemic antibiotics and anti-inflammatory medicines with your doc.  Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.  Take care  Regards, Dr Bhagyesh V. Patel, General Surgeon   \r",

The doctors said that was completely normal. It was very dark red. Is that normal? Doctor: Hello,  * The pneumonia does not give rise to red urine called hematuria. * There can be possible causes for red blood cells in the urine as  - uncontrolled urinary tract infection - kidney damage via systemic sepsis - abnormal clotting factors or platelet function - side effects of drugs - dehydration related - secondary effects of diabetes - others  * Kindly share all reports if available with you for further discussion ahead and guide in details.

Patient: Throat a bit sore and want to get a good imune booster, especially in light of the virus. Please advise. Have not been in contact with Nyone with the virus. Doctor: During this pandemic. Throat pain can be from a strep throat infection (antibiotics needed), a cold or influenza or other virus, or from some other cause such as allergies or irritants. Usually, a person sees the doctor (call first) if the sore throat is bothersome, recurrent, or doesn't go away quickly. COVID-19 infections tend to have cough, whereas strep throat usually lacks cough but has more throat pain. (3/21/20)  \r",

Doctor: Yes, Maybe, Maybe. We presume one is immune to a respiratory virus for a while after getting the infection (that's the way it is with other viruses). A few people have trouble with their antibodies and don't have much immunity. Shedding of viruses sometimes is longer than 14 days. In life, there will always be some people who get reinfected, for whatever reason. Usually one is immune after the infection. (3/21/20)  \r",
